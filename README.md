# C# Codility Solutions
-----------------

My C# solutions to the Codility tasks at https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/

Almost all of the tasks were straightforward and the available time was more than enough, but few took me more than the 120min to reach 100% ._.

These are my own implementations. As I enjoy small and concise codes, whatever doesn't fit in this rule means that I had problems. Until now, there's one code in this category :)
